<h1>Todo</h1>
This is a simple todo list web app that allows users to create, read, and delete todo items.

<h2>Functionality</h2>
Create new todos by entering text into the input field and clicking the Add button
Mark todos as completed by clicking on them

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The app uses an array to store todo items in local storage

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
Future improvements could include:

Ability to update todos
